  content : "In the far north of British Columbia and on the easternmost edge of the Rocky Mountains lies Pink Mountain. Its unique combination of altitude, latitude and geology makes Pink Mountain one of a kind in the province and a very special place. The summit of Pink Mountain is Arctic/Alpine tundra – one of the harshest habitats on Earth. The biodiversity on Pink Mountain is astonishing but it is the community of rare and rarely seen plants that truly sets it apart."

      content : "Hi Mr. Traynor, I want to thank you for the wonderful job that you did on my Family Bible. I didn't know when I first found you if you would be able to repair it. Once I got the finished product I was thrilled. To be able to hold and look through this family heirloom means a lot. You described in detail what you would do to repair it and you also were very upfront over pricing and detail. You kept your word on the pricing and the length of time needed to do the job. You were very professional and I couldn't have found a better person to fix my Family Bible. If I ever hear of anyone needing books repaired I will highly recommend you."

Many many thanks indeed for maintaining the integrity of the dictionary but putting it into a useable condition.  I think my Dad would smile if he knew that it is now still able to be used. I think the idea of what you have done is appropriate for the condition in which the dictionary was sent to you.  If it had been somewhat better it would have been good to keep the original cover etc., but obviously in light of what had to be done this was not possible. I will mail off a cheque to you today. And thank YOU again for the fine workmanship, VERY much appreciated."
